# Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for the Bitcoin Converter API.

## Authentication

- API keys are used to authenticate requests. Keys should be passed in request headers.
- API keys have different access levels restricting access to endpoints. Access is granted based on roles.

See [Authentication Docs](auth.md) for more details.

## Authorization

- Access control is enforced based on user roles and permissions.
- The principle of least privilege is followed.

## Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting prevents abuse and denial of service attacks.
- Requests are limited to 100 per minute per API key.

## Input Validation

- User input is validated and sanitized before processing.
- This prevents common attacks like XSS, SQLi, etc.

## Data Encryption

- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- AES 256 encryption is used for data encryption. 

## Secure Error Handling

- Errors are handled securely without exposing details.
- Errors are logged for internal tracking but not revealed to clients.

## Security Monitoring

- API activity is monitored for suspicious behavior. 
- Alerts are configured for potential issues.

See the [Monitoring Docs](monitoring.md) for more info.

## Reporting Issues

Please report security issues responsibly to main@bitcoincab.net
